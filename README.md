🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot Task 1 - CodeSoft AI Internship 📌 Project Overview This is a simple rule-based chatbot built as part of the AI Internship Program at CodeSoft. The chatbot responds to user inputs using predefined rules, implemented with if-else statements and pattern matching.

It demonstrates the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversation flow, helping beginners understand how chatbots can identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.

🔍 Features Text-based chatbot interaction in the terminal/console

Responds to common greetings and questions

Handles unrecognized inputs gracefully

Supports exit commands to end the chat

Demonstrates:

String pattern matching (in, re.search)

If-else logic for query detection

Basic conversational flow
